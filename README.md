# Reversible reactions of the first order

![reversible_gif](reversible_interactive.gif)

A simple script to plot Concentration vs Time or Reaction quotient vs Time plots for reversible first order reactions. Interactive plots can also be made following [tutorial](tutorial.ipynb) instructions. An interactive Colab notebook can also be used <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/chicolucio/ReversibleFirstOrder/blob/main/colab/interactive_colab.ipynb" target="_blank">
